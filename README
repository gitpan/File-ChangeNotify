NAME
    File::ChangeNotify - Watch for changes to files, cross-platform style

SYNOPSIS
        use File::ChangeNotify;

        my $watcher =
            File::ChangeNotify->instantiate_watcher
                ( directories => [ '/my/path', '/my/other' ],
                  filter      => qr/\.(?:pm|conf|yml)$/,
                );

        if ( my @events = $watcher->new_events() ) { ... }

        # blocking
        while ( my @events = $watcher->wait_for_events() ) { ... }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an API for creating a File::ChangeNotify::Watcher
    subclass that will work on your platform.

    Most of the documentation for this distro is in
    File::ChangeNotify::Watcher.

METHODS
    This class provides the following methods:

  File::ChangeNotify->instantiate_watcher(...)
    This method looks at each available subclass of
    File::ChangeNotify::Watcher and instantiates the first one it can load,
    using the arguments you provided.

    It always tries to use the File::ChangeNotify::Watcher::Default class
    last, on the assumption that any other class that is available is a
    better option.

  File::ChangeNotify->usable_classes()
    Returns a list of all the loadable File::ChangeNotify::Watcher
    subclasses.

DONATIONS
    If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
    consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free
    time creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care
    to offer.

    Please note that I am not suggesting that you must do this in order for
    me to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to
    do so, inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

    Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on
    this software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can
    consider working on free software full time, which seems unlikely at
    best.

    To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use the
    button on this page: http://www.urth.org/~autarch/fs-donation.html
