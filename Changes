0.12   2010-01-28

- Added auto_features to the Build.PL, which will give hints on what modules
  to install for KQueue and Inotify support.

- Require Linux::Inotify 1.2+, since 1.1 apparently doesn't work with this
  module. Reported by Michael Grondin. RT #54069.


0.11   2009-12-07

- A test attempted to use Test::Without::Module but this wasn't in the prereq
  list. I've made the test check for the module and skip its tests if the
  module isn't present. Reported by Leon Brocard. RT #52539.


0.10   2009-12-06

- Attempting to instantiate more than one watcher failed if you were on a
  system where one of the watcher subclasses could not be loaded (which is
  basically every system because no system has both inotify and kqueue). Patch
  by Mark Grimes. RT #52477.


0.09   2009-11-09

- This release fixes the excluded-dirs.t under Windows. There are no other
  changes in this release, so there's no need to upgrade if you have 0.08
  installed. Patch by Taro Nishino. RT #51161.


0.08   2009-11-05

- Added a new exclude feature that allows you to excludes files or directories
  outright. Implemented by Dan Thomas. RT #51062.

- Added a KQueue-based watcher written by Dan Thomas. I have no idea if this
  works, as I don't have BSD, but we'll assume he ran the tests on his system
  ;) RT #51062.


0.07   2009-06-29

- Fixed a typo in File::ChangeNotify::Watcher that causes a warning
  with newer versions of Moose. Reported by David Raab. Fixes RT
  #47431.


0.06   2009-06-03

- Created a Makefile.PL from the Build.PL.


0.05   2009-05-17

- Update the Moose::Params::Validate prereq so it requires the version
  we really need (0.08+).

- Removed Cwd and FindBin from our prereq list.


0.04   2009-05-14

- The Default watcher would blow up when a directory it was watching
  was later removed. Reported by Tomas Doran.

- The Inotify watcher would generate two events when a directory it
  was watching was removed, one delete and one unknown, rather than
  just a delete event.


0.03   2009-05-11

- Removed the default value for directories in the Watcher class,
  because setting this value is really an app-specific task.


0.02   2009-05-10

- Not having Linux::Inotify2 caused attempting to make a watcher blow
  up, when it should just use the Default watcher. Reported by Florian
  Ragwitz.

- Fixes a a bug in the Default watcher that causes it die
  when trying to sleep in the wait_for_events method.

- Fixed warnings from the Default watcher in the face of symlinks that
  point to nonexistent files.


0.01   2009-05-07

- First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
